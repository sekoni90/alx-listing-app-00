# ALX Listing App

A modern web application inspired by Airbnb, designed to showcase property listings with a clean, reusable component structure. The goal is to provide a scalable foundation for building a property rental or listing platform.

## Project Structure

- **interfaces/**: Stores TypeScript interfaces and types for props and data models, ensuring type safety and maintainability.
- **constants/**: Holds reusable constants, such as API URLs, configuration settings, and UI text.
- **public/assets/**: Contains static assets like images and SVGs used across the project (e.g., placeholder property images).
